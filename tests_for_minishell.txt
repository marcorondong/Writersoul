1. Create a variable FOO='"a*k"'
2. Create a file named: "alk"
--> (touch '"alk"')
3. Run echo $FOO
-> it should output "alk"
If not, test in bash to demonstrate ho bash do it
==============================================================================
printf "%s\n" """"''''""******"."********""""''

check to see if they print all filenames:
the ones that have even/odd chars after/ferore the match.
==============================================================================
valgrind --leak-check=full --trace-children=yes ./minishell
echo | < Makefile cat

""

"

This produces SIGPIPE, because echo opens the pipe to write to it;
but then it has an input redirection from cat; but no one is reading from the pipe
So the pipe fails. This will get executed by the child, so the child will have leaks
(but not for execve which are "below main")
==============================================================================
- Check if it compiles outside the folder

- Check for this:
minishell> .
minishell> "
minishell> '

minishell> <<EOF cat
minishell> <<"EOF" cat


export var1="fdfdfdf ' fdfdf"
echo $var1
